Extra important info!
--
Age regressing - I involuntarily age regress A LOT (Meaning it happens out of control and randomly), Please iwec during these times because i can be really sensitive.

W2iuf - I mainly have this on because i have really bad social anxiety, I do not like people coming up to me unless they are friends so please only whisper to int!

Triggers - I have mild cover trigger, Unless its friends i will probably just hide you if your covering me, Same thing with excessive touching/booping.

C+H - You will literally never find me alone, I am always either sitting with my best friends, Online family or jst my family in general so c+h is welcomed unless with them.

Misspelling - I misspell things a lot due to being half blind and dyslexic, I have a hard time thinking before i type too.. And i usually type very fast too 😅.

Fandoms - Sth, Pjsk, Dr/Ut & dw plsplss iwec, I have had really bad experiences with these fandoms so please be careful when interacting with me.

Ships - Idm if you ship something i dont or something i do, Just please don't try to engage in a roleplay with me, Majority of my skins are hvykins or my 2 core kins.

Roleplay - I don't rp with randoms, Yes i do use onomatopoeias a lot (like, punches, smacks and stuff lol) but that doesn't mean im roleplaying.. I only rp with close friends 🙏🏾
